# stepperstack
StepperStack is a general purpose stepper motor driver, with integrated motion control features.

The durable construction of StepperStack Motion Controller makes it a good choice for many projects.

It fits neatly into a breadboard during prototyping, or can be chassis-mounted in equipment.

StepperStack is ideal for motor sizes NEMA23 and smaller.

The default operating mode is Passive mode, which uses Step and Direction signals for compatibility with most existing systems.

In Active mode, motion is controlled via UART serial interface to add smooth motion to your project.
