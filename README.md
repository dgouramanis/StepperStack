# stepperstack
StepperStack is a general purpose stepper motor driver, with integrated motion control features.

The durable construction of StepperStack Motion Controller makes it a good choice for many projects.

It fits neatly into a breadboard during prototyping, or can be chassis-mounted in equipment.

StepperStack is ideal for motor sizes NEMA23 and smaller.
